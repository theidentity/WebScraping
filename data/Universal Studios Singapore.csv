Pretty good. ,"We went to universal trying to look at as people who’ve never been to US Florida. Not easy.

A bit crowded,"There are numerous choices of rides and attractions but it may take more than an hour waiting time for exciting rides such as Human, Xylone, Mummy, Transformers, etc. depending on time of the day and day of the week. But, it's worth the wait.",JeanRaltique,,2.0

Don't expect amazing only go if you can afford the queue jumper,"If you have been to other big parks like Disney don't go expecting anything close. This is by comparison a small park just good enough to keep you occupied for the day.
To start with the ticketing system is rubbish, buying online in advance seemed...More",Bevan W,"Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand",1.5

Universal Studios - physically exhausting,"Great place for all ages. But long lines for all rides. No line for Express tickets, but that is expensive. Senior citizens have 50% discount.",Ashok J,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",2.5
Be a big kid again,"Beautifully clean attraction, as is the rest of Sentosa. Downfall was the long lines at each ride. Definitely is worth getting the express pass to get priority on rides. Well organised, and fun experience",stessymags,"Hastings, New Zealand",2.0
Park is undersized. Not goo organisation. You can only enjoy 6pm to 8pm,"Attractions are extremely nice, but the amount of people is too much vs. what the park can handle.
